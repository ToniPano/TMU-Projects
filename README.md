# TMU-Projects
Projects for my courses at Toronto Metropolitan University

## ELE 838 - Systems on Chip Design - W2022
Used SystemC to simulate basic digital circuits and generate their waveforms for static timing analysis.
Implemented 

Note: SystemC is difficult to get working on Windows. It's much easier to install SystemC on Linux. I had to rely on the Linux lab computers at Uni to complete my labs.

## COE 302 - Digital Circuits - F2018
